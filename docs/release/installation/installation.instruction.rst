vHello_Tacker: A single-node simple python web server,
connected to two internal networks (private and admin),
and accessible via a floating IP. Based upon the OpenStack Tacker
project's "tosca-vnfd-hello-world" blueprint, as extended for testing
of more Tacker-supported features as of OpenStack Newton.

Further description of the tests is provided on the Models wiki at

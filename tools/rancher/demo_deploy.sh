#. What this is: Complete scripted deployment of an experimental Rancher-based
#. cloud-native application platform. When complete, Rancher and the following
#. will be installed:
#. - nginx and dokuwiki as demo applications
#. - prometheus + grafana for cluster monitoring/stats
#.   Prometheus dashboard: http://<master_public_ip>:9090
#.   Grafana dashboard: http://<master_public_ip>:3000
#.
#. Prerequisites:
#. - Ubuntu server for Rancher cluster nodes (admin/master and agent nodes)
#. - MAAS server as cluster admin for Rancher master/agent nodes
#. - Password-less ssh key provided for node setup
#. Usage: on the MAAS server
#. $ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/models ~/models
#. $ bash ~/models/tools/rancher/demo_deploy.sh <key> "<hosts>" <master_ip>
#.     "<agent ips>" [<extras>]
#. <key>: name of private key for cluster node ssh (in current folder)
#. <hosts>: space separated list of hostnames managed by MAAS
#. <master_ip>: IP of cluster admin node
#. <agent_ips>: space separated list of agent node IPs
#. <extras>: optional name of script for extra setup functions as needed
